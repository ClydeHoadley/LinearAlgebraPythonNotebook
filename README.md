# This is more play than work.

## Create a Jupyter notebook for python 3.x and use it to develop a Linear Algebra self study guide.
## focus on the Linear Algebra but python and NumPy can come along for the ride.

I'm studying Linear Algebra by using python and Jupyter notebooks.  At the same time I'm learning more about python, Jupyter notebooks, GitHub, and Markdown coding.  I hope to be able to include optional voice narration inside the notebook.

Downloaded first project ZIP file and was able to run the notebook and test out the ogg file.  It worked!!
